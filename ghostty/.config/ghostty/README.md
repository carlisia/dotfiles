## My favorite features

- Having a global key bind for toggling a quick terminal window. ❤️

- How it was made to be reconfigurable so easily. Every developer tools should have this philosoly. Looking at you iTerm. :)

## Not loving (but not really)

I haven't found anything that makes my terminal usage worse off by using Ghostty, only the opposite. But, as I try to be diligent in moving away from mouse habits, it would be nice to be able to take actions like opening urls and other things using key bindings. Keeping an eye on this known issue: ["Hints" mode to quickly select and act on arbitrary text patterns visible in the terminal · ghostty-org/ghostty · Discussion #2394](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/2394).
